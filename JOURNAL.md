## 10/10/2025 4:20 PM - Research and organization  

Imma get started with explaining what I'm doing.

The other day I was watching reels and saw this
![juego-interactivo-super-decoder---giiker-4.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTM5NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1790b01892cf3436b6374be4b8d16a375f44b816/juego-interactivo-super-decoder---giiker-4.jpg)

But then I saw the price, 50â‚¬, a hell nah twin.

So I decided I'm gonna make a open source logic puzzle console with a bunch of puzzles and games you can easily program and add to an SD card, using an 8x8 neopixel matrix as the display, one OLED as a screen to navigate menus, two rotary encoders as controller input 

I did a bunch of research and designed some stuff in my mind and winded up with that, I also will be using a 2.7V battery and a battery charger + buck converter to power the thing.

I spent like, 2 hours, probably more testing circuits with components I have lying around the house, so I have a material list ready, I need to tests the components and design the pcb.  

## 10/10/2025 4:54 PM - Quick correction   

I meant 3.7V, not 2.7)
V, a 18650 cell to be exact, with the TC4056 as a charging circuit and a buck converter to go up to 5V and power the pico + matrix.

This should power everything and with the Pico's efficiency the main power drawer is the matrix, but brightness will be adjustable, I also forgot to mention I plan to add a buzzer/speaker for little sounds and such

## 10/11/2025 - PCB and curcuit  

I started working on making the PCB, made a bunch of symbols and most of the circuit
![Screenshot 2025-10-11 194230.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTY0MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5ba0c743337b9913a8d3660f721a937d0b0d8625/Screenshot%202025-10-11%20194230.png)

I still have the amp, speakers and oled to go but It's mostly done.
As for the PCB I have an initial wip layout done ![Screenshot 2025-10-11 194056.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTY0NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a5283a7517b107ab74033400115bd1bae40f0e44/Screenshot%202025-10-11%20194056.png)

And a better and more complete shopping cart!

Going quick cause this project is mostly software sooo
Seya!
  

## 10/12/2025 - Finishing of circuit, PCB layout + research  

I added the speaker amp into the circuit, and made the PCB layout more efficient, it can now fit two cells for extra battery! plus some other icons, and made research on how the amp works + other stuff 

Now I'm onto the 3D modeling for the case and LED diffusion.

## 10/13/2025 12 AM - Made a 3D model  

I made a 3d case, it has a door for hot swapping batteries, made on F360 for 3D printing, I will be printing and testing fits tonight, I tried to keep it as thin as possible but 3D printing has its limitations, and I lack some measurements for some components, but all will be fixed with time!

## 10/13/2025 4 PM - Final 3D model and PCB  

I have made some big changes too the 3D model, I saw some issues after printing it myself, some dimension issues that came from the pcb holes, which I have fixed, also usb didn't fit so my bad, fixed that aswell, so last thing I need is a BOM will I will make soon!

  ![pilogic64 v4.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjAwMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--42f145dfca0ad8a0ee911feb8c5f345371ec3b1c/pilogic64%20v4.png)

## 10/13/2025 6 PM - BOM, routing  

Finished routing the PCB, changed SD card orientation cause it ain't fitting any other way.
![Screenshot 2025-10-13 172104.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjAyMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--d9c4aaf983774fc6b5700ce02b24aa3341e01a85/Screenshot%202025-10-13%20172104.png)
I have a BOM ready and setup, I use a pico 2 (1 should work) for the brains, a OLED display for menu navigation, an 8x8 matrix as the game screen, two rotary encoder as input, and a audio amp and two speakers for sound. Powering that are two 18650 cells charged by a TP4056 and boosted to 5V, with an SD card to easily and dynamically import games.

## 10/21/2025 - Parts arrived! Testing!  

So the parts (But the batteries) got here today! I have been all evening testing each component individually and they all work great' now that I can take the final measurements for everything i will soon finish the PCB + 3D case and then can get to coding everything together!! looking promising!
(please ignore my mess of a desk)

## 10/25/2025 - Final PCB + Final 3D model and more!  

I finally finished and ordered the PCB, biggest change is the power switch (totally forgot abt it), I took one from a cheap gift console and used that so I don't need to buy anything, Also finished the case, now the pcb needs to arrive and be assembles and then time to code
