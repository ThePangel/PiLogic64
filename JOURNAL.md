## 10/10/2025 - Research and organization  

Imma get started with explaining what I'm doing.

The other day I was watching reels and saw this
![juego-interactivo-super-decoder---giiker-4.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTM5NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1790b01892cf3436b6374be4b8d16a375f44b816/juego-interactivo-super-decoder---giiker-4.jpg)

But then I saw the price, 50â‚¬, a hell nah twin.

So I decided I'm gonna make a open source logic puzzle console with a bunch of puzzles and games you can easily program and add to an SD card, using an 8x8 neopixel matrix as the display, one OLED as a screen to navigate menus, two rotary encoders as controller input 

I did a bunch of research and designed some stuff in my mind and winded up with that, I also will be using a 2.7V battery and a battery charger + buck converter to power the thing.

I spent like, 2 hours, probably more testing circuits with components I have lying around the house, so I have a material list ready, I need to tests the components and design the pcb.
