## 10/10/2025 4:20 PM - Research and organization  

Imma get started with explaining what I'm doing.

The other day I was watching reels and saw this
![juego-interactivo-super-decoder---giiker-4.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTM5NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1790b01892cf3436b6374be4b8d16a375f44b816/juego-interactivo-super-decoder---giiker-4.jpg)

But then I saw the price, 50â‚¬, a hell nah twin.

So I decided I'm gonna make a open source logic puzzle console with a bunch of puzzles and games you can easily program and add to an SD card, using an 8x8 neopixel matrix as the display, one OLED as a screen to navigate menus, two rotary encoders as controller input 

I did a bunch of research and designed some stuff in my mind and winded up with that, I also will be using a 2.7V battery and a battery charger + buck converter to power the thing.

I spent like, 2 hours, probably more testing circuits with components I have lying around the house, so I have a material list ready, I need to tests the components and design the pcb.  

## 10/10/2025 4:54 PM - Quick correction   

I meant 3.7V, not 2.7)
V, a 18650 cell to be exact, with the TC4056 as a charging circuit and a buck converter to go up to 5V and power the pico + matrix.

This should power everything and with the Pico's efficiency the main power drawer is the matrix, but brightness will be adjustable, I also forgot to mention I plan to add a buzzer/speaker for little sounds and such

## 10/11/2025 - PCB and curcuit  

I started working on making the PCB, made a bunch of symbols and most of the circuit

I still have the amp, speakers and oled to go but It's mostly done.
As for the PCB I have an initial wip layout done ![Screenshot 2025-10-11 194056.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTY0NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a5283a7517b107ab74033400115bd1bae40f0e44/Screenshot%202025-10-11%20194056.png)

And a better and more complete shopping cart!

Going quick cause this project is mostly software sooo
Seya!
  

## 10/12/2025 - Finishing of circuit, PCB layout + research  

I added the speaker amp into the circuit, and made the PCB layout more efficient, it can now fit two cells for extra battery! plus some other icons, and made research on how the amp works + other stuff 

Now I'm onto the 3D modeling for the case and LED diffusion.
